# SmartAttendanceSmart Attendance System
# Overview
The Smart Attendance System is an automated facial recognition-based attendance tracking application. It utilizes OpenCV for face detection, a pre-trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for face recognition, and CSV files for recording attendance. The system overlays the captured video on a background image for enhanced visual presentation.

# Features
Real-time Face Detection and Recognition: Uses OpenCV for detecting and recognizing faces in real-time.
Automated Attendance Marking: Automatically records attendance with a timestamp in a CSV file.
Edge Case Handling: Manages unrecognized faces and ensures students are not marked multiple times.
CSV Logging: Attendance records are stored in CSV files for easy access and management.
Visual Overlay: Captured video frames are displayed on a background image for a better user interface.
